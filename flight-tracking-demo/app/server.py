"""Flight Tracking Integration — sandbox-side FastAPI server.

Serves a single-page MapLibre + deck.gl frontend, proxies the OpenSky Network
API for live aircraft state, exposes a curated OpenFlights airport dataset,
forwards the chat panel to OpenClaw's local agent (which already has the
flight-tracking skill loaded), and broadcasts external map commands to all
connected browsers over a WebSocket bus.

Design notes
------------
- Runs entirely inside the OpenShell sandbox. The browser reaches it through
  `openshell forward start <sandbox> 0.0.0.0:18890` (the install script
  configures this).
- OpenSky is reached one of two ways:
    * **Tier-1 host proxy (default)** — `OPENSKY_PROXY_URL` points at a
      Python daemon running on the host (outside the sandbox) which
      reads OAuth2 credentials from `~/.nemoclaw/credentials.json`,
      mints/refreshes bearer tokens, and forwards to opensky-network.org.
      The sandbox itself never sees the client_id or secret. Mirrors
      the Planet integration's `planet-proxy.py` pattern.
    * **Direct (legacy / dev)** — when `OPENSKY_PROXY_URL` is unset and
      `OPENSKY_CLIENT_ID`/`OPENSKY_CLIENT_SECRET` are present in the
      env, we run the OAuth2 client_credentials dance ourselves.
      Anonymous fallback (~400 credits/day) when neither is set.
  Responses are cached briefly in-process either way so several open
  browsers don't burn through the daily credit budget.
- The chat panel does *not* call inference directly. It exec's
  `openclaw agent --json` so OpenClaw owns auth, model selection, skill
  routing, and conversation memory — exactly the way the TUI works. The
  flight-tracking skill we deploy at install time gives that agent the
  recipes it needs to drive the map (curl into /api/map/*).

# `--json` for batch), but it writes its session JSONL incrementally
# during the turn. We piggy-back on that file: spawn the subprocess,
# poll the JSONL while the subprocess is alive, and emit each new
# event as a line of NDJSON to the client. The final assistant reply
# (parsed from the subprocess's stdout JSON when it exits) is sent as
# a `done` event.
#
# Wire shape (one JSON object per line, `\n` delimited):
#   {"type":"event","kind":"tool_call","tool":"exec","command":"curl …"}
#   {"type":"event","kind":"tool_result","is_error":false,"text":"{ … }"}
#   {"type":"event","kind":"thought","text":"…"}
#   {"type":"done","reply":"…","session_id":"…","status":"ok"}
#   {"type":"error","error":"…"}                        (on failure)
#
# The client buffers events until `done` and renders them under the
# assistant bubble live, regardless of whether the user has the
# trace-toggles on (off = events arrive but get dropped).
# ── Live progress feed ──────────────────────────────────────────────

# when the turn ends, so tailing that file (see run_and_tail below)
# can't show anything until the agent is already done — hence the long
# "Agent working…" wait with no feedback.
#
# But EVERY tool the agent runs is an HTTP call it curls at our own
# loopback (127.0.0.1:18890), whereas real browsers hit us from their
# public IP. So we tap loopback /api hits in a ring buffer, and the
# streaming endpoint replays any that fall inside the active turn as
# `progress` events. That gives real-time "Centering the map…",
# "Analyzing traffic around IAD…" status updates that don't depend on
# OpenClaw flushing anything, and show up regardless of the user's
